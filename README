TrelloWIPLimits v0.1
====================

A simple Google Chrome extension that adds work-in-progress limits to [Trello](http://trello.com) lists supporting a Kanban workflow. To set a WIP limit on a list, include the limit in braces in the list title (e.g., "My List [4]). When the number of cards in the list exceeds the limit, the list background will turn red.
